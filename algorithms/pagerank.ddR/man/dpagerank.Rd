\title{Distributed PageRank}
\description{
dpagerank function is a distributed implementation of the PageRank algorithm.
}
\usage{
dpagerank(dgraph, niter = 1000, eps = 0.001, damping=0.85, 
            personalized=NULL, weights=NULL, trace=FALSE, 
            na_action = c("pass","exclude","fail"))
}

\arguments{
  \item{dgraph}{
    a darray (dense or sparse) that contains the adjacency matrix of the graph. A sparse darray is strongly recommended for memory efficiency. The darray must be column-wise partitioned.
  }
  \item{niter}{
    maximum number of iterations
  }
  \item{eps}{
    the calculation is considered complete if the difference of PageRank values between iterations change less than this value for every vertex.
  }
  \item{damping}{
    the damping factor
  }
  \item{personalized}{
    optional personalization vector (of type darray). When NULL, a constant value of 1/N will be used where N is the number of vertices. This darray should be dense and have a single row. The number of its columns should be equal to the number of vertices. Number of partitions should be the same as dgraph.
  }
  \item{weights}{
    optional edge weights (of type darray). When NULL, a constant value of 1 will be used. The dimensions, sparsity, and partitioning of this darray should be the same as dgraph.
  }
  \item{trace}{
    when TRUE, intermediate steps of the progress are displayed.
  }
  \item{na_action}{
    indicates what should happen when dgraph contains missing values. Values of NA, NaN, and Inf in the adjacency matrix are treated as missing values. Three options for this argument are 'pass', 'exclude', and 'fail'. The default value is 'pass' which means missing values will not be checked. When 'exclude' is selected, any edge with missing value will be replaced with zero. When 'fail' is selected, the function will stop in case of any missing value in the input adjacency matrix.
  }
}

\value{
dpagerank returns a darray which contains the PageRank vector.
