I'm pretty worried about performance and usability of this thing. 
Performance in terms of how long it will take to run, usability in terms of
how feasible it is to use this on anything other than simulated data.
Before I proceed further down this path I'm going to do a few benchmarks
to see if I can get some rough estimates for the bounds on performance.

`do_mapply` is the heart of ddR; everything uses it. Right now my suspicion
based on casual use
is that the version of `mapply` I've implemented on Spark is going to be to
expensive, implying that `do_mapply` will be expensive. Then to get some
reasonable lower bound for performance we can check:

1) How many calls to `do_mapply` happen in various operations.
2) How expensive is a single call to `mapply` on Spark (best and worse
   case).


### How many calls to `do_mapply` happen in various operations?

Following [this
example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21687514/r-count-function-calls)
use a global count. This should be fine as long as it runs sequentially.

```

library(ddR)

count = 0L

tracer = function(){
    assign("count", count + 1L, .GlobalEnv)
}

trace(do_dmapply, tracer = tracer, print = FALSE)

count_dmapply = function(code_text){
    assign("count", 0L, .GlobalEnv)
    eval(parse(text = code_text), envir = .GlobalEnv)
    get("count", .GlobalEnv)
}

count_all = function(codevec){
    out = data.frame(code = codevec, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    out$calls = sapply(codevec, count_dmapply)
    out
}


```

Initializing simple objects:

```

init_ct = count_all(c(
    "dlist(1:10, letters, runif(10))"
    , "as.dframe(iris)"
    , "as.dframe(iris, psize=c(5, 1))"
))

init_ct

```
